- **loan_model.py**: This script contains all data processing, model training, and fairness auditing steps.
- **submission.csv**: Model's output on the provided test dataset ('test.csv').
- **Visual Evidence of Bias**: Charts have been generated in the current directory:
  - `bias_visualization_selection_rate.png` (Predicted Approval rate by Race)
  - `confusion_matrix.png` (Overall Confusion Matrix)
  - `feature_importance.png` (Feature Importance Chart)
  - `demographic_analysis.png` (Predicted Approval Rates by various demographics)

**Model Performance Summary (on Full Loan_Access_Dataset Predictions):**
Total predictions: 10000
Overall predicted approval rate: 0.366
Actual approval rate (full dataset): 0.431
Overall Accuracy (full dataset): 0.815
Demographic Parity Difference (Race): 0.143
Note: DPD closer to 0 indicates better fairness
